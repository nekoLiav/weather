# Weather

[LIVE DEMO](nekoliav.github.io/weather/)

<h3>Project Details:</h3>
<p>This project is a part of the Full Stack JavaScript path of The Odin Project's curriculum.</p>
<p>The objective of this project was to learn how to asynchronously make calls to an external API, allowing the call stack to remain unblocked in the event of a slow request.</p>

<h3>Feature List:</h3>
- Displays the current weather, as well as the 7 day forecast</br>
- Uses browser's built-in geolocation API, which will optionally prompt users for their location and automatically populate the weather data if accepted</br>
- Allows users to search for locations using the geolocation API provided by OpenWeatherMap, in the event that they decline the geolocation prompt or want to see weather elsewhere

<h3>Created With:</h3>
JavaScript w/ ES6 modules</br>
Webpack</br>
[date-fns](https://date-fns.org/v2.28.0/docs/format/)</br>
